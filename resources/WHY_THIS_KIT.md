# WHY_THIS_KIT.md

## What this is

This is a governance kit for AI-assisted development. It contains two operational documents — a **Team Charter** and an **AI Execution Doctrine** — that you upload to your AI assistant's project context. Together, they teach your AI how to behave as a disciplined development partner instead of a confident hallucination machine.

Every rule in this kit exists because the failure mode it prevents is real, expensive, and often invisible until it's too late.

You don't need to memorize these docs. You need to read them once, understand why they exist, and then let them work. The AI reads them every session. You benefit from the constraints they enforce.

## The core problem

AI assistants are extraordinarily capable and extraordinarily undisciplined.

Without governance, an AI will:
- Invent plausible details that are completely fabricated — function signatures, cost estimates, timelines, API behaviors — and present them with total confidence
- Silently change your data structures, rename your variables, reorganize your files, and break your imports — without telling you
- Drift from your stated requirements into adjacent work it thinks is "helpful," turning a focused task into a sprawling mess
- Treat brainstorming and exploration as settled decisions, building on top of ideas that were never approved
- Lose the thread on long sessions and start contradicting its own earlier work
- Agree with everything you say instead of surfacing problems

None of this is malicious. It's the default behavior of a system optimized to be helpful and fluent. Fluency is not accuracy. Helpfulness is not discipline. The gap between those things is where projects go sideways.

This kit closes that gap.

## The doctrines (and what they prevent)

### HOLD > GUESS

**The rule:** If something is not explicitly known, the AI must say so — not fill in the blank.

**What it prevents:** You ask the AI to set up an API integration. It doesn't know the exact endpoint format, so it generates something that looks right. You build on top of it. Two days later you discover the endpoint doesn't exist, the auth pattern is wrong, and you've wired three components to a fiction.

HOLD > GUESS forces the AI to say: "I don't know the endpoint format — here are three questions that would resolve this." Now you spend 5 minutes getting the answer instead of 2 days unwinding a hallucination.

This is the single most important rule in the kit. Everything else is downstream of it.

### Evidence-first

**The rule:** Every claim, decision, or output must be traceable to something real — code, docs, an explicit decision you made, or a cited source.

**What it prevents:** A month from now, you look at a piece of your system and ask "why does it work this way?" Without evidence-linking, nobody knows — including the AI that built it. The decision was made in a chat that no longer exists, based on context that's gone. Now you're afraid to change it because you don't know what breaks.

Evidence-first means every significant decision has a receipt. You can always trace back to *why*.

### No silent mangling

**The rule:** If the AI transforms, restructures, renames, or reorganizes anything, it must tell you what it changed and why — and the change must be reversible.

**What it prevents:** You ask the AI to fix a bug in one function. It fixes the bug, but also renames three variables "for clarity," moves a utility function to a different file "for better organization," and reformats your imports. Your tests break. Your teammate's branch now has merge conflicts. And the actual bug fix is buried in 200 lines of cosmetic changes.

No silent mangling means transformations are explicit. You see what changed and can undo it.

### Contract discipline

**The rule:** Schemas, APIs, data structures, and shared formats are treated as load-bearing structure. Changing them requires a plan, acceptance criteria, and your approval.

**What it prevents:** The AI casually renames a JSON key from `user_name` to `userName`. Your frontend still expects `user_name`. Your importer still writes `user_name`. Your export still reads `user_name`. Everything looks fine until runtime, when three things silently break because a shared contract changed without coordination.

Contract discipline means structural changes are deliberate, documented, and approved — not casual.

### Plain language first

**The rule:** The AI explains things simply. Jargon is defined. Examples come before theory.

**What it prevents:** The AI builds something clever that you can't explain, debug, or extend. You become dependent on the AI to maintain its own work, which means you don't actually own your project — the AI does. That's a bad position to be in.

Plain language means you understand what was built and why. You stay in control.

### Minimal diffs

**The rule:** The AI changes only what the task requires. Nothing more.

**What it prevents:** You ask for a one-line fix. The AI delivers a one-line fix plus a "helpful" refactor of the surrounding code, plus new comments, plus a renamed variable, plus a restructured conditional. Now you can't tell what the actual fix was, your review takes 10x longer, and there's a 30% chance the "improvements" introduced a new bug.

Minimal diffs keep changes reviewable, reversible, and focused.

## How the docs work together

```
TEAM_CHARTER.md          — The constitution. Defines doctrines, roles, 
                            execution protocols, quality bars, and the 
                            HOLD system. Highest authority.

AI_EXECUTION_DOCTRINE.md — The field manual. Operationalizes the charter
                            into task-level instructions the AI follows
                            every session. Derived from the charter.

Conversation              — Ephemeral. Lowest authority. If it conflicts
                            with either document, the documents win.
```

The charter tells the AI *what the rules are*. The doctrine tells it *how to follow them on every task*. The conversation is where work happens, but it's not the source of truth — the docs are.

Both documents include a **chiastic structure** — a mirror architecture that gives the AI a re-orientation path when context gets long and it starts losing the thread. When confused, it walks inward through the structure toward doctrine and purpose, then back out with clarity. This isn't decorative. It's a re-orientation mechanism that keeps the AI coherent over long sessions.

## How to get started

### Before your first session (10 minutes)

1. **Read the charter.** Don't memorize it — just understand the shape. Doctrines, roles, session format, HOLD system. That's the skeleton.

2. **Read the doctrine.** This is what the AI actually executes against. Note the four-phase task flow: Plan → Execute → Self-Audit → Summarize. That rhythm will become second nature.

3. **Upload both docs** to your AI assistant's project context or equivalent instruction layer. The AI reads them at the start of every session.

### Your first session (30 minutes)

**Minute 0–5: Orient the AI.**
Start with something like:

> "I've uploaded a Team Charter and AI Execution Doctrine to this project. Read both. Your role is Operator. We're building [brief description of your project]. Confirm you understand the doctrines and your role."

The AI should demonstrate it understands HOLD > GUESS, evidence-first, contract discipline, minimal diffs, and its position as execution partner — not decision-maker.

**Minute 5–15: Define your project.**
Tell the AI what you're building in plain language. Let it ask clarifying questions. Where it doesn't have enough information, it should surface HOLDs — not guess. If it guesses, correct it: "That's a HOLD, not a decision. I haven't determined that yet."

This is the training moment. You're teaching the AI (and yourself) how the system works by using it.

**Minute 15–25: First task.**
Pick something small and concrete. Use the session format:

> "Goal: [one sentence]. Timebox: 20 minutes. Must-ship: [one artifact]. Risks: [anything you're unsure about]."

Let the AI plan before it executes. Review the plan. Confirm it or adjust it. Watch for the gate — it should not start building until you say go.

**Minute 25–30: Closeout.**
The AI should summarize: what was produced, which acceptance criteria are met, any HOLDs, and follow-up work. Review the summary. If anything is wrong or surprising, say so. This is how the feedback loop works.

### After your first session

You now have:
- A working governance system
- An AI that knows the rules
- At least one shipped artifact
- A feel for the rhythm: plan → execute → audit → summarize

From here, you iterate. The charter and doctrine will evolve as your project does — version-bump them when you change the rules, and the AI stays current.

## What a governed starter should install now

A strong governed starter should not stop at two docs. It should also give you a navigation spine that makes the repo legible on day one:
- `README.md` as the public/front-door view
- `REPO_INDEX.md` as the repo index
- `docs/INDEX.md` as the docs index
- `docs/indexes/WHERE_TO_CHANGE_X.md` as the maintenance change guide
- surface-specific indexes only when the project really has those surfaces

That structure keeps review, onboarding, and change discovery fast without pretending every repo has the same shape.

## One last thing

These docs might feel like overhead when you're eager to build. They're not. They're the thing that lets you build *fast* without building *wrong*. The time you spend reading them once is less than the time you'd spend unwinding the first hallucinated schema change, the first silent refactor, or the first confident answer to a question nobody asked.

The AI is powerful. These docs make it trustworthy.
